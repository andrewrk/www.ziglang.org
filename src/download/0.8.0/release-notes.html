    A green check mark (✅) indicates the target meets all the requirements for the
    support tier. The other icons indicate what is <em>preventing the target from
      reaching the support tier</em>. In other words, the icons are
    <strong>to-do items</strong>. If you find any wrong data here please

    <ul>
      <li>Not only can Zig generate machine code for these targets, but the standard
        library cross-platform abstractions have implementations for these targets.</li>
      <li>🧪 The CI server automatically tests these targets on every commit to master
        branch.</li>
      <li>📦 The CI server automatically produces pre-built binaries for these targets,
        on every commit to master, and updates
        <a href="https://ziglang.org/download/">the download page</a> with links.</li>
      <li>These targets have debug info capabilities and therefore produce stack traces
        on failed assertions.</li>
      <li>libc is available for this target even when cross compiling.</li>
      <li>🐛 All the behavior tests and applicable standard library tests pass for this target.
          All language features are known to work correctly. Experimental features do not
          count towards disqualifying an operating system or architecture from Tier 1.</li>
      <li><code>zig cc</code>, <code>zig c++</code> and related toolchain commands support
        this target.</li>
      <li>💀 If the Operating System is proprietary then the target is not marked deprecated
        by the vendor,
        <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208436">such as macos/x86</a>.</li>

    <ul>
    <li>📖 The standard library supports this target, but it's possible that some
      APIs will give an "Unsupported OS" compile error. One can link with libc or other
      libraries to fill in the gaps in the standard library.</li>
    <li>🔍 These targets are known to work, but may not be automatically tested, so there
      are occasional regressions.</li>
    <li>Some tests may be disabled for these targets as we work toward
      {#link|Tier 1 Support#}.

    {#header_open|macOS Support#}
    <p>With the advent of the {#link|Self-Hosted Linker#}, Zig is now able to generate
    well-formed and codesigned binaries on arm64 macOS (aka the Apple Silicon).
    It is also able to cross-compile C, C++, and Zig code to an arm64 and x86_64
    macOS. Additionally, arm64 nightly binaries of Zig are automatically generated
    by our Continuous Integration service, meaning both arm64 and x86_64 macOS are
    now {#link|Tier 1|Tier 1 Support#} targets.
    </p>
    <p>
    To facilitate incremental linking, the self-hosted compiler is now by default generating
    <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/lldb/lldb-179.1/www/symbols.html"><code>dSYM</code> bundles</a> which store DWARF debug information and debug symbols on macOS.
    This puts Zig on path of becoming a true replacement for the Xcode development environment.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, as a side experiment, Jakub added in {#link|Zig Build System#} integration
    with <a href="https://www.darlinghq.org/">Darling</a> (#8760), a translation layer of macOS
    syscalls to Linux, with the intention of being able to cross test MachO binaries
    and macOS specific tests directly on Linux simply by passing in an additional flag
    <code>-Denable-darling</code> to <code>zig build test</code>.

          usage improvement.</li>

        <li>Resolve builtin types and values via <code>std.builtin</code> rather than via

          <code>std.builtin</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    The good news here is that nearly all these fixes come with additional behavior tests, which
    we can use to verify the {#link|Self-Hosted Compiler#} does not regress.
    </p>
    <p>
    One especially noteworthy change here is LemonBoy's fix to ask LLVM to produce compact
    code in -OReleaseSmall mode. Previously, using -OReleaseSmall sometimes resulted in 
    larger output binaries than -OReleaseFast! (#7048, #7077)
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Big, big thanks to LemonBoy</strong> for solving so many stage1 bugs during this release cycle. This
    is high effort, low-appreciation, huge-impact work that he has been doing. But in reality
    he has been single-handedly keeping us afloat while we work towards finishing the
    {#link|Self-Hosted Compiler#}.

    {#header_open|LLVM 12#}
    <p>
    This release of Zig upgrades to
    <a href="http://releases.llvm.org/12.0.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html">LLVM 12</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    This was a rough release cycle for downstream users of LLVM. During testing of the release
    candidates, we found and reported 7 regressions from LLVM 11. However, despite having
    reproducible regressions reported as release blockers, the LLVM project tagged release
    12.0.0. Not only were there open regressions at this time, but the 12.0.0 tag did not
    even tag the tip of the release/12.x branch - so there were <em>fixes already committed
    into the release branch that did not make it into the tag</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
    At the time of this writing, there are
    <a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=release-12.0.1">31 open release blockers for 12.0.1</a>,
    and yet LLVM has already tagged 12.0.1-rc1. As
    <a href="https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-May/150800.html">Michał Górny puts it</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
I've started testing, hit two bugs I've already reported for 12.0.0 RCs
and figured out I'm wasting my time.  It seems that LLVM reached
the point where releases are pushed through just for the sake of
releases and QA doesn't exist.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    I hope the LLVM project can step up and take releases and regressions more seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
    Either way, it is starting to become clear that
    <a href="https://kristoff.it/blog/zig-new-relationship-llvm/">transitioning LLVM to an optional dependency</a>,
    and thereby providing an alternative to the LLVM monoculture,
    is becoming more and more of an attractive feature for the Zig project to offer.
    In this release you can see that we have broken ground on this front:
    {#link|x86-64 Backend#}, 
    {#link|AArch64 Backend#}, 
    {#link|ARM Backend#},

    {#header_open|CPU Feature Detection#}
    TODO
    stage2: Add framework for host CPU detection on Linux
    
    Add a generic framework to parse /proc/cpuinfo and implement the model
    detection for 64bit SPARC targets as proof of concept.

    stage2: Add CPU feature detection for macos
    
    This is mostly meant to detect the current and future AArch64 core types
    as the x86 part is already taken care of with OS-independent machinery.


    stage2: Drop LLVM's host CPU detection method as fallback
    
    The CPU detection code is nearly at feature parity, we do support
    detecting the native CPU on Sparc systems and macos, our ARM/AArch64
    model list is quite comprehensive and so is our PPC one.
    
    The only missing pieces are:
    - ARM32 detection on Darwin hosts (I don't think anybody is planning on
      running the compiler on a old-ass iPhone)
    - s390x detection on Linux hosts, this can be easily added at a later
      stage.


    stage1: Implement CPU host detection for PowerPC targets

    {#header_open|AArch64 Backend#}
<p>The experimental self-hosted AArch64 (a.k.a. ARM64) backend is new in this version.
Currently, the self-hosted compiler is able to generate binaries for Linux (ELF) and macOS
(Mach-O, thanks to Jakub Konka). Currently, only a very small subset of the Zig language
is supported.</p>
    {#header_close#}

    {#header_open|ARM Backend#}
    <p>
Bitwise operations on and multiplication of 32-bit integers were introduced. Furthermore, conditional branching (including while- and for-loops) is now possible. Additionally, the register allocation mechanism was overhauled, allowing for correct code generation in situations where registers are spilled.

    {#header_open|WebAssembly Backend#}
    <p>A lot of progress has been made with regards to the WebAssembly backend, both
    architecturally and in terms of feature completeness.</p>

    <p>During the self-hosted compiler meeting of
    <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Self-Hosted-Compiler-Meetings#2020-12-10">2020-12-10</a>
    we discussed on how to move forward with the architecture of the backends.
    A proof of concept was done in <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/7321">#7321</a>
    to merge it with the other backends. However, it was found to be counter intuitive and
    ultimately decided upon to keep the wasm backend seperately.
    </p>
    <p>
    Apart from this design decision, progress was made to bring up the wasm backend closer towards feature completeness:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement storing and loading of locals (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/7726">#7726</a>)</li>
        <li>Refactoring the wasm backend to streamline its implementation with the other backends. (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/7797">#7797</a>)</li>
        <li>Support for control flow such as while loops and if statements. (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/7895">#7895</a>)</li>
        <li>Importing and calling of extern functions. Allowing to call host functions from within Zig. (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/7960">#7960</a>)</li>
        <li>Unary operator '!' support. (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/8339">#8339</a>)</li>
        <li>Opcode builder and multiple binary operands implemented. (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/8416">#8416</a>)</li>
        <li>"Hello world" support (arrays and pointer to arrays). (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/8439">#8439</a>)</li>
        <li>Enums (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/8789">#8789</a>)</li>
        <li>Initial implementation of structs and switches. (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/8847">#8847</a>)</li>
        <li>Support for error sets and error unions. (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/8923">#8923</a>)</li>

    <p>This backend, related to the <a href="https://ashet.computer/">Ashet Home Computer</a>
    project, was incomplete, and the maintainer stopped working on it. Since it never made it
    to a usable state, this backend is removed in 0.8.0.</p>
    <p>
    The code is still safely stored in the Git history, and anyone is welcome to revive it!

    {#header_open|Self-Hosted Linker#}
    <p>As you may know from our previous releases, we had immense problems with
    <code>ld64.lld</code> linker on macOS - it is subpar in functionality to other target
    formats (Elf, Coff, etc.) and it does not support the latest arm64-based Macs
    (see #7527 or #3295 for some of the issues we encountered). While there has been
    progress on the new lld's MachO backend dubbed <code>ld64.lld.darwinnew</code>,
    it is still not the default backend as of {#link|LLVM 12#}. Additionally, it is
    doubtful that the new backend will allow for seamless cross-compilation to macOS
    since every macOS binary is required to be a PIE and link dynamically against
    <code>libSystem</code> dylib, which will require the lib's presence on the host
    for the lld to reference and link against.</p>

    <p>These were enough to make
    <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1535">a case for building our own linker, written entirely in Zig</a>,
    which would initially focus on MachO linking. Since our core team member,
    Jakub, has already been working on the stage2 MachO backend before,
    he decided to try his luck at writing a traditional MachO linker in Zig from scratch
    which he started towards the end of January 2021. Fast forward a couple of months,
    and since May 2021, we are incredibly happy to report it is used as our primary
    linker when targeting macOS and is successfully able to link the stage1 Zig compiler
    as part of the <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig-bootstrap">zig-bootstrap</a>
    effort (see
    <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig-bootstrap/issues/38">ziglang/zig-bootstrap#38</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig-bootstrap/issues/44">ziglang/zig-bootstrap#44</a>).
    </p>

    <p>This means Zig can be used to successfully cross-compile C/C++ (clang) and Zig
    to macOS from anywhere!</p>

    <p>In summary, cross-compiling C/C++ and Zig to macOS is now as trivial as adding
    <code>-target aarch64-macos</code> or <code>-target x86_64-macos</code> to the invocation
    of your chosen Zig tool ({#link|zig cc#}, {#link|zig c++#}, or <code>zig build-exe</code>).
    There are still bits of functionality that are missing such as the ability to create a
    dynamic library or
    <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/8935">linking against text-based definitions (<code>.tbd</code>s)</a>
    but Jakub plans to address these next.</p>

    <p>In celebration of Jakub's recent accomplishments of improving the self-hosted linker
    on Mach-O enough to be able to link LLVM, Clang, LLD, and Zig, we now have the tracking issue
    <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/8726">Completely Eliminate Dependency on LLD</a>
    with the goal of eventually completely relying on our own linker implementation for all
    targets, and entirely stop linking against LLD.
    </p>
    <p>This issue does not block the release of Zig 1.0, however it is a stretch goal, and a
    fun indicator of progress to keep track of along the way.</p>
    <p>Here are all the places we depend on LLD, along with an indicator of how much our
    own linker code can do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🟡 ELF:<ul>
          <li>🟡 x86, x86_64</li>

    <ul>
      <li>🟢 major progress</li>
      <li>🟡 some progress</li>
      <li>🔴 no progress</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Another issue to note here is that this release does <em>not</em> include a drop-in
    linker sub-command, e.g. <code>zig ld</code>. At this time Zig is lacking the glue
    code to hook up the Command-Line Interface to the linker implementation.
    If you are interested in this use case, the tracking issue is
    <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/8755">zig ld: a drop-in linker replacement</a>.

    {#header_open|Standard Library#}
    <p>The Zig standard library is still unstable and mainly serves as a
    testbed for the language. After the {#link|Self-Hosted Compiler#} is completed,
    the {#link|language|Language Changes#} stabilized, and
    {#link|Package Manager|Package Manager Status#} completed, then it will be time
    to start working on stabilizing the standard library.
    Until then, experimentation and breakage without warning is allowed.</p>

    Made formatBuf UTF-8 aware.
    Add 'u' specifier to format
    std: Implement named arguments & runtime width/precision
    LemonBoy reworked the whole parser

    remove z/Z format specifiers. Zig's format system is flexible enough to add custom formatters.  This PR removes the new z/Z format specifiers that were added for printing Zig identifiers and replaces them with custom formatters.

    Also fix the `*` specifier for more types, print an error message if we
    can't show the value address.

    std: Disable the special casing of {} for u8 slices/arrays
    Unless {s} is specified the contents won't be treated as a string.

    Improve error messages in std.fmt (#7898)


    std.zig.fmt escaped string formatting recognizes single quote style
    
    This introduces {'} to indicate escape for a single-quoted string,
    and {} to indicate escape for a double quoted string.
    
    Without this, there would be unnecessary \' inside double quoted
    strings, and unnecessary \" inside single quoted strings.
    
    Motivated by the llvm12 branch, in the new tool I am writing for
    updating target CPU features.

    std: Deprecate 'x'/'X'/'e'/'E' special cases for u8 slices
    
    Let's follow the road paved by the removal of 'z'/'Z', the Formatter
    pattern is nice enough to let us remove the remaining four special cases
    and declare u8 slices free from any special casing!

    std: Deprecate the B and Bi format specifiers
    
    Following #8007 and #8137 let's get rid of the last weird format.

    <p>Even the man page contradicts the behavior. It says:
    "strip last component from file name". Now consider, if you
    remove the last item from an array of length 1, then you
    have now an array of length 0. After you strip the last component, there
    should be no components remaining. Clearly, returning the input parameter
    unmodified in this case does not match the documented behavior. This is
    my justification for taking a stand on this API design.</p>

    std: introduce a thread-local CSPRNG for general use (#6704)
    
    std.crypto.random
    
    * cross platform, even freestanding
    * can't fail. on initialization for some systems requires calling
      os.getrandom(), in which case there are rare but theoretically
      possible errors. The code panics in these cases, however the
      application may choose to override the default seed function and then
      handle the failure another way.
    * thread-safe
    * supports the full Random interface
    * cryptographically secure
    * no syscall required to initialize on Linux (AT_RANDOM)
    * calls arc4random on systems that support it
    
    `std.crypto.randomBytes` is removed in favor of `std.crypto.random.bytes`.
    
    I moved some of the Random implementations into their own files in the
    interest of organization.
    
    stage2 no longer requires passing a RNG; instead it uses this API.

    std.crypto.random: introduce fork safety
    
    Everybody gets what they want!
    
     * AT_RANDOM is completely ignored.
     * On Linux, MADV_WIPEONFORK is used to provide fork safety.
     * On pthread systems, `pthread_atfork` is used to provide fork safety.
     * For systems that do not have the capability to provide fork safety,
       the implementation falls back to calling getrandom() every time.
     * If madvise is unavailable or returns an error, or pthread_atfork
       fails for whatever reason, it falls back to calling getrandom() every
       time.
     * Applications may choose to opt-out of fork safety.
     * Applications may choose to opt-in to unconditionally calling
       getrandom() for every call to std.crypto.random.fillFn.
     * Added `std.meta.globalOption`.
     * Added `std.os.madvise` and related bits.
     * Bumped up the size of the main thread TLS buffer. See the comment
       there for justification.
     * Simpler hot path in TLS initialization.

    <p>RFC 7253 was published in 2014. OCB also won the CAESAR competition along with AEGIS that we already had.

    <p>So, why isn't everybody using it instead of GCM? And why didn't we have it in Zig before?

    <p>The sad reason for this was patents. GCM was invented only to work around these patents, and for all this time, OCB was that nice thing that everybody knew existed but that couldn't be freely used.

    <p><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/qLTveWOdTJcLn4HP3ev-vrj05Vg/">That just changed in February 2021</a>. The OCB patents have been abandoned, and OCB is now public domain.

    <p>And a specialized function can be much faster than computing both multiplications separately.</p>

    {#header_open|P-256#}
    <p>They were invented by a US government agency. They are prone to side channels. Secure or not, implementations tend to be slow. Renowned cryptographers <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to">don't trust them much</a>. And Zig already includes better alternatives such as Ristretto255.</p>

    <p>But the NIST curves are deployed everywhere. Far more than any other curves. For compliance reasons or simply because most protocols don't support anything else, we need them.</p>

    <p>Zig 0.8.0 adds support for the NIST P-256 curve. Other prime-order curves will follow shortly.</p>

    <p>Since they don't use "nice" primes, safely implementing finite field arithmetic for these curves is tricky, and many implementations got hit by carry propagation bugs.</p>

    <p>We took the approach of contributing a Zig backend to <a href="https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto">fiat-crypto</a>, a project to generate arithmetic that has been formally proven for correctness.</p>
    
    <p>The output of that tool is the core of our P-256 implementation, making Zig the first general-purpose language with formally verified cryptography right in the standard library. Support for other curves will be done the same way.</p>

    <p>Please note however, that verification stops at source-level, and doesn't protect against possible compiler bugs.</p>

    {#header_open|MultiArrayList#}
    TODO
    Also known as "Struct-Of-Arrays" or "SOA". The purpose of this data
    structure is to provide a similar API to ArrayList but instead of
    the element type being a struct, the fields of the struct are in N
    different arrays, all with the same length and capacity.
    
    Having this abstraction means we can put them in the same allocation,
    avoiding overhead with the allocator. It also saves a tiny bit of
    overhead from the redundant capacity and length fields, since each
    struct element shares the same value.
    
    This is an alternate implementation to #7854.

    {#header_open|Progress#}
    TODO

    std: Better handling of line-wrapping in Progress
    
    In order to update the printed progress string the code tried to move
    the cursor N cells to the left, where N is the number of written bytes,
    and then clear the remaining part of the line.
    This strategy has two main issues:
     - Is only valid if the number of characters is equal to the number of
       written bytes,
     - Is only valid if the line doesn't get too long.
    
    The second point is the main motivation for this change, when the line
    becomes too long the terminal wraps it to a new physical line. This
    means that moving the cursor to the left won't be enough anymore as once
    the left border is reached it cannot move anymore.
    
    The wrapped line is still stored by the terminal as a single line,
    despite now taking more than a single one when displayed. If you try to
    resize the terminal you'll notice how the contents are reflowed and are
    essentially illegible.
    
    Querying the cursor position on non-Windows systems (plot twist,
    Microsoft suggests using VT escape sequences on newer systems) is
    extremely cumbersome so let's do something different.
    
    Before printing anything let's save the cursor position and clear the
    screen below the cursor, this way we ensure there's absolutely no trace
    of stale data on screen, and after the message is printed we simply
    restore it.

    I'm aware of the few remaining references to SegmentedList that exist in
    the std lib, but they are dead code, and so I'm leaving the dead
    references as a clue that the code is dead. Cleaning up dead code will
    be a separate effort that involves code coverage tools to make sure we
    find it all.

    {#header_open|Zig Build System#}
    <p>
    The Zig Build System is invoked via the <code>zig build</code> command, which executes
    a declarative <code>build.zig</code> script to collect options and describe the graph
    of steps, and then provides options to execute those steps.
    </p>
    <p>
    Although it is already essential to nearly every Zig project, the Zig Build System is
    still experimental and unstable. As a build system, stability is especially important,
    but stabilization cannot occur until the language stabilizes. Language stability is the
    next area of focus on the {#link|Roadmap#}.
    </p>

    <p>The first thing you will immediately notice in this release is that the
    default install prefix is now <code>zig-out</code> in the build root, rather than
    <code>zig-cache</code> in the current working directory (#8659). The <code>-p</code>
    flag can be used to choose a different install prefix.</p>

    <p>
    In addition, there are the following improvements:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Support specifying rpaths explicitly (#8912).</li>
      <li><code>installDirectory</code> supports a <code>blank_extensions</code> option
        to blank out files instead of omitting them. This is utilized by Zig's build script
        so that the installation does not include many megabytes of test files, but
        also {#syntax#}@import{#endsyntax#} on them does not cause a compile error.</li>
      <li>Added experimental Darling support for cross testing macOS.</li>
      <li>Fixed wrong glibc dir passed to qemu for i386.</li>
      <li>If using a RunStep, show the command run on verbose (#8571).</li>
      <li>Added LibExeObjStep.linker_allow_shlib_undefined field to set --allow-shlib-undefined</li>
      <li>std.build: make Builder.install_prefix non optional
        This is useful for build.zig files to check in some cases, for example
        to adhere to the convention of installing config to /etc instead of
        /usr/etc on linux when using the /usr prefix. Perhaps std.build will
        handle such common cases eventually, but that is not yet the case.</li>
      <li>Added support for LTO configuration.</li>
      <li>Added support for passing write file args as build options (#7909).
        Makes it easier to generate Zig code in a build.zig script.</li>
      <li>Dupe strings on all public api points for std.build.</li>
      <li>Propagate env_map for child processes.</li>
      <li>Assert that install paths are relative. If absolute paths are passed they
        will work unless $DESTDIR is set, which causes subtly broken build.zig's.</li>
      <li>Made build errors followed by two newlines.</li>
      <li>Added {#syntax#}sanitize_thread{#endsyntax#} option.</li>
      <li>Added option to override default stack size in build system.</li>
      <li>{#syntax#}addBuildOption{#endsyntax#} gains support for more types: {#syntax#}SemanticVersion{#endsyntax#}, floats, {#syntax#}?[:0]const u8{#endsyntax#}</li>
      <li>Dynamic library artifacts are now passed as positionals.</li>
      <li>COFF linking: fix incorrectly passing .dll instead of .lib</li>

    {#header_open|Roadmap#}
    <p>
    According to the
    <a href="https://ziglang.org/download/0.7.0/release-notes.html#Roadmap">0.7.0 Roadmap</a>,
    the major theme of the 0.8.0 release was supposed to be <strong>stabilizing the language</strong>,
    <strong>creating a first draft of the language specification</strong>, and
    <strong>self-hosting the compiler</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>TODO</p>
    <p>
    The major goal of the 0.9.0 release cycle is to finish the self-hosted compiler and ship it,
    deleting the C++ implementation of Zig. If you are concerned about bootstrapping, see this
    issue:
    <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/6378">#6378: Allow the feature of O(1) bootstrapping to temporarily regress</a>
    </p>

    {#header_open|Package Manager Status#}
    <p>
    Having a package manager built into the Zig compiler is a
    <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/943">long-anticipated feature</a>.
    Zig 0.8.0 does not have this feature.
    </p>
    <p>
    If the package manager works well, people will use it, which means building Zig projects
    will involve compiling more lines of Zig code, which means the Zig compiler must get faster,
    better at incremental compilation, and better at resource management.
    </p>
    <p>
    Therefore, the package manager depends on finishing the
    {#link|Self-Hosted Compiler#}, since it is planned to have these
    improved performance characteristics, while stage1 is not planned to have them.
    </p>

    {#header_open|Accepted Proposals#}

    <p>Special thanks to Ave and Luna of <a href="https://lavatech.top/">LavaTech</a>, who are
    hosting an instance of <a href="https://sourcehut.org/">SourceHut</a> for our Continuous Integration
    pipeline, but with more RAM than the main sr.ht service allows. Thanks to this, FreeBSD now has
    significantly more test coverage, most notably all the standard library tests.</p>

    Special thanks to those who <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/ziglang/">sponsor Zig</a>.
    Because of you, Zig is driven by the open source community, rather than the goal of making profit.
    In particular, these fine folks sponsor Zig for $50/month or more:
